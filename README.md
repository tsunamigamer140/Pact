# Pact : Android Application

Pact is a real-time Privacy Policy conciser that fits over any Android application and offers various features to enhance your privacy and lets you know EXACTLY what you're signing up for.

The mobile application is still in development, with the Overlay almost at full functionality (for now). The home application is still sparse. The overlay works for a small number of apps (apps that have their privacy policy in plain old HTML without any javascript fancy-work). Functionality is being added to allow retrieval of any kind of privacy policy with any webpage type for any app.
